/**
 * @brief The inner display/rendering widget of a Viewer class.
 *
 * Actual composition occurs elsewhere offscreen and
 * multithreaded, so its main purpose is receiving a finalized OpenGL texture and displaying it.
 *
 * The main entry point is SetTexture() which will receive an OpenGL texture ID, store it, and then call update() to
 * draw it on screen. The drawing function is in paintGL() (called during the update() process by Qt) and is fairly
 * simple OpenGL drawing code standardized around OpenGL ES 3.2 Core.
 *
 * If the texture has been modified and you're 100% sure this widget is using the same texture object, it's possible
 * to call update() directly to trigger a repaint, however this is not recommended. If you are not 100% sure it'll be
 * the same texture object, use SetTexture() since it will nearly always be faster to just set it than to check *and*
 * set it.
